 A comprehensive study on the effectiveness of four Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models - ResNet, EfficientNet_b0, MobileNetV3 large, and 
Vision Transformer (ViT) - in classifying images from a Knife Dataset.The primary focus lies in examining how different learning rates influence the training performance 
of these models. Employing a systematic approach, the study evaluates each model's accuracy and efficiency under varying learning rate conditions. Key findings 
indicate significant variances in model performance, with certain models displaying superior adaptability to learning rate modifications. These results provide insightful 
revelations about the optimal deployment of CNN models for image classification tasks, particularly in applications requiring the discrimination of knife images. The study's 
findings offer valuable contributions to the field of image classification, highlighting critical considerations in the selection and tuning of CNN models for specific tasks. The experiment was performed on Google Colab with Tesla T4 GPU.
